        <p> <b>Stephen William Hawking  </b> CH CBE FRS FRSA was an English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics" target="_blank">theoretical physicist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology" target="_blank">cosmologist</a> , and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Theoretical_Cosmology" target="_blank">Centre for Theoretical Cosmology </a>  at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a> .Between 1979 and 2009, he was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics" target="_blank">Lucasian Professor of Mathematics</a>  at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.</p>

            Hawking was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford" target="_blank">Oxford</a>  into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College,_Oxford" target="_blank"> University College, Oxford</a>, where he received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#First_Class_Honours" target="_blank">first-class</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree" target="_blank">BA degree</a>  in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Hall,_Cambridge" target="_blank">Trinity Hall</a> at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" target="_blank"> PhD degree</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics" target="_blank"> applied mathematics</a> and theoretical physics, specialising in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" target="_blank"> general relativity </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology" target="_blank"> cosmology</a>. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis" target="_blank"> motor neurone disease</a> (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – ALS, for short) that gradually, over the decades, paralysed him.[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-generating_device" target="_blank"> speech-generating device</a> initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle

            Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" target="_blank"> Roger Penrose</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose%E2%80%93Hawking_singularity_theorems" target="_blank"> gravitational singularity theorems</a> in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" target="_blank"> black holes</a> emit radiation, often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank"> Hawking radiation</a>. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank"> quantum mechanics</a>. He was a vigorous supporter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" target="_blank"> many-worlds interpretation</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">quantum mechanics</a>.

        <div class="para4">Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science" target="_blank"> popular science</a> in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time" target="_blank"> A Brief History of Time </a>appeared on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times" target="_blank"> Sunday Times </a>bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" target="_blank"> Fellow of the Royal Society</a>, a lifetime member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences" target="_blank"> Pontifical Academy of Sciences</a>, and a recipient of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" target="_blank"> Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" target="_blank"> BBC's</a> poll of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons" target="_blank"> 100 Greatest Britons</a>. He died in 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neuron disease for more than 50 years.</div>
